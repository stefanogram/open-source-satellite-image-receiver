# Satellite Image Viewer

This is a Next.js application that fetches and displays satellite images from NASA's Earth API based on user-provided coordinates and date.

## Features Implemented:

- Fetching satellite imagery using NASA's Earth API.
- User interface with input fields for longitude, latitude, and date.
- Displaying the fetched satellite image.
- Server-side API route for secure API key handling and request logging.
- Basic UI improvements for input fields, button, and image responsiveness.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result (Note: port may vary if 3000 is in use).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
